                <p> My Name is Jalen Bailey and I am a FullStack Developer in training.
                  I am currently learning how to code and I am very excited about this 
                  new course in my life. I am engaged and soon to be married in October
                  of this year.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I am a student at the University of Utah and I am learning how to code. 
                  Creating websites using HTML and CSS at the moment is part of my curriculum.
                  I am someone who likes to go outdoors and drive in my Jeep, go exploring in Moab 
                  and play video games with my friends when I have some free time.
